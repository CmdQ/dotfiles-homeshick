Homeshick needs to be there first, which is manual:
git clone https://github.com/andsens/homeshick.git $HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick

Next, do
$HOME/.homesick/repos/homeshick/bin/homeshick clone CmdQ/dotfiles

and go to
$HOME/.homesick/repos/dotfiles/non-config
to run
./install.sh

If you want Docker in WSL, see docker.md
